## My Technical Journey 🛠️
I've spent years honing my craft in:

### Daily Companions
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Node.js & Python
- React & NextJS
- Vite & NestJS
- Django & Go

### Favorite Tools
- Git (because history matters)
- npm Package Development (sharing is caring)
- CI/CD (automating the boring stuff)

## Proud Creations 💡

### Folder Validator
*My contribution to happier development teams*

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/folder-validator.svg)

![Node.js Version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/folder-validator)

This is my solution to a common problem: keeping project structures consistent across teams. It's like having a friendly guardian for your codebase that ensures everything stays where it should be.

**What makes it special:**
- Zero dependencies (because simplicity matters)
- Real-time validation (catching issues before they become problems)
- Developer-friendly configuration (because life's too short for complicated setups)
